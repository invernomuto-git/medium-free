# Medium Free with Google Cache

Medium is a good place to keep up to date if you work on the web, although the articles tend to have click bait titles and focus on current trends (e.g. Chatgpt and AI tools at the moment).

Medium uses a paywall and allows you to read the entire articles only upon subscription, but it's a foodie and wants to be well indexed on Google, to which it provides the full text of the articles. It would therefore be possible, in theory, to read the complete articles by querying the Google cache, except that Medium has inserted a check to prevent this from happening, which makes the Google cache page completely blank to the visitor.

eg. http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https://tomaszs2.medium.com/5-awesome-php-projects-simplified-php-development-and-time-tracking-tools-ep-2-4316c71d9eeb

This extension allows you to add a button to the browser which, if clicked when you are on a Medium article, opens the corresponding cached copy of Google and tries to keep the content readable, even if the solution found is not stylistically excellent from a stylistic point of view. But it works.

This is my first extension, so there will surely be many things to improve and fix. Contact me and I will try to give you feedback as soon as possible.
